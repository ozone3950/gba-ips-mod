# GameBoy Advance IPS Modding Guide
This repository will show you how to mod a regular GameBoy Advance (AGB-001) by replacing the screen with a backlit, much nicer IPS screen.

# Required Parts and Tools
- GameBoy Advance (AGB-001)
- [GBA IPS Screen](https://funnyplaying.com/products/4-pixels-in-1-ips-full-viewing-angle-gameboy-advance-replacement-project?_pos=2&_sid=cadb7c2fc&_ss=r)
- Multi-bit Screwdriver
  - Tri-wing, and small phillips bits
- [Custom Shell](https://funnyplaying.com/products/agb-ips-coustom-shell?_pos=4&_sid=4bcdda627&_ss=r&variant=31961886883901) (Recommended)
- [Buttons](https://funnyplaying.com/products/agb-custom-buttons?_pos=15&_sid=304ea9080&_ss=r&variant=31961937707069) and [Silicon Pads](https://funnyplaying.com/products/replacement-silicone-pads-for-gameboy-advance?_pos=4&_sid=304ea9080&_ss=r&variant=29490486018109) (Optional)

Though the custom shell is recommended, you do not need one since you are able to cut around the edge of the inside hole of the screen. This **will not** be shown in this guide. However, I will be using custom buttons.

# Guide
1. Remove the battery panel, batteries, then unscrew the 6x tri-wing screws and singular phillips screw under where the batteries were.

2. Take out the L+R buttons, bumpers, and power switch from the system. Then, unscrew the 3x phillips screws on the motherboard.

3. Carefully, pull up the 2 plastic tabs, then carefully remove the ribbon cable.

4. Next, remove the silicon pads and buttons if you would like to reuse them. If you want, you can tape the ribbon cable to the back of the screen, to prevent damage.

5. Install the IPS screen. Since I've already assembled this previously, I am unable to show you how to install the screen. [Here](https://www.retromodding.com/blogs/tutorials/game-boy-advance-ips-v2-lcd-installation-guide) is a guide from Retromodding. After that, proceed to place the buttons and silicon pads back into the shell of the system, then put the motherboard above. Make sure the speaker is in the correct position.

6. Screw in the motherboard with the 3x phillips screws from the original GBA. Then, place the L+R buttons, bumpers, and power switch on the edge of the system.

7. After that, gently insert the ribbon cable, and push down the plastic tabs when done.

8. Proceed to screw the back of the shell into place. Same as last time, 6x tri-wing screws and a small phillips in the battery bay. Since the shell comes with screws already, the screws from the previous shell can double as spares in case you lose any.

9. Once finished, put the batteries back in, followed by the battery cover.

# Results and Comparison

There you have it. The original GameBoy advance from 2001, but with a stunning, bright, colour-accurate IPS screen.
