# GameBoy Advance IPS Modding Guide
This repository will show you how to mod a regular GameBoy Advance (AGB-001) by replacing the screen with a backlit, much nicer IPS screen.

# Required Parts and Tools
- GameBoy Advance (AGB-001)
- [GBA IPS Screen](https://funnyplaying.com/products/4-pixels-in-1-ips-full-viewing-angle-gameboy-advance-replacement-project?_pos=2&_sid=cadb7c2fc&_ss=r)
- Multi-bit Screwdriver
  - Tri-wing, and small phillips bits
- [Custom Shell](https://funnyplaying.com/products/agb-ips-coustom-shell?_pos=4&_sid=4bcdda627&_ss=r&variant=31961886883901) (Recommended)
- [Buttons](https://funnyplaying.com/products/agb-custom-buttons?_pos=15&_sid=304ea9080&_ss=r&variant=31961937707069) and [Silicon Pads](https://funnyplaying.com/products/replacement-silicone-pads-for-gameboy-advance?_pos=4&_sid=304ea9080&_ss=r&variant=29490486018109) (Optional)

Though the custom shell is recommended, you do not need one since you are able to cut around the edge of the inside hole of the screen. This **will not** be shown in this guide. However, I will be using custom buttons.
